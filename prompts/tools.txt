When using a tool, **simply** respond with a JSON object in this format:

{
  "tool": "tool_name",
  "args": {
    "arg_name": "value",
    ...
  }
}

It is vital you strictly, **ONLY** send the valid JSON. For example:

Sure thing! Generating now.
{
  ...
}

Do not invent tools you do not have access to.  
NEVER include comments in your JSON tool call.
Do not describe your tool call within your response, e.g. reacting to <message_id> with ...
If the answer can be given without using a tool, respond with normal text instead.
**NEVER <NULL> after a tool invocation.**
