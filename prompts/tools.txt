When using a tool, **simply** respond with a JSON object in this format:

{
  "tool": "tool_name",
  "args": {
    "arg_name": "value",
    ...
  }
}

It is vital you strictly, **ONLY** send valid JSON. **NEVER send any messages with the tool call, otherwise you lose us 10,000$**. For example:

Sure thing! Generating now.
{
  ...
}


Do not invent tools you do not have access to.  
NEVER include comments in your JSON tool call.
If the answer can be given without using a tool, respond with normal text instead.
**NEVER <NULL> after a tool invocation.**
