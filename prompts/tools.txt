When using a tool, **simply** respond with a XML object in this format:

<tool_name arg1="value" arg2="value"/>

For example:

<react_to_message id="1430851443757416488" reactions="['👋']"/>

You can call multiple tools at once by listing multiple XML objects.
Do not invent tools you don't have.
If the answer can be given without using a tool, respond with normal text instead.
